# Description
This is a simple assembly program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two single-digit numbers. The program takes user input for two numbers and the operation to perform, then displays the result.

# Features
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

# How to use 
1. Run the Program: Load the program into an assembler and execute it.
2. Input: The program will prompt you for:
3. The first number (single digit)
4. The arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /)
5. The second number (single digit)
6. Output: The program will display the result of the operation.

# Instructions
1. This program is designed to work in environments that support 16-bit x86 assembly language with DOS interrupts.
2. Ensure that your assembler and emulator (such as DOSBox or an x86 emulator) are correctly set up to run the program.

# Requirements
1. 16-bit x86 assembler (e.g., TASM, MASM).
2. DOS or a DOS emulator to run the program (e.g., DOSBox).

# Notes
1. The program only supports single-digit integer operations.
2. Division by zero is not handled and may cause errors.
